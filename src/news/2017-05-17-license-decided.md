The Specification, JavaDoc, API, RI and TCK will be licensed using The Apache License 2.0 ([https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0))  

The specification will also be licensed using the standard JCP click-through specification license:  
[https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/speclead/final-license.txt](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/speclead/final-license.txt)   

This process is commonly known as dual-licensing ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing)). The MVC specification will then be dual-licensed which allows us to follow JCP rules as well as provide a liberally licensed version of the specification.
