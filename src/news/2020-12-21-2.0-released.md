We are very proud to announce that Jakarta MVC 2.0 has been released. You can
get the final version of the specification document and the final API docs 
on the [specification page](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/mvc/2.0/). 
All Maven artifacts are available in the Maven Central repository. 
This includes the API JAR the and final version of Eclipse Krazo.

If you want to learn more about Jakarta MVC 2.0, have a look at the 
[Installation Guides](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/krazo/downloads/2.0.0.html) which will teach you how to get started 
with your first Jakarta MVC 2.0 application.

If you are currently using an earlier version of the spec, 
just update your dependencies. Make sure you are running your application on a [Jakarta EE 9 compatible implementation](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/#tab-9).
